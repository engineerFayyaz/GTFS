                            Welcome to our Average Speed Calculator tool. This tool helps you determine the average speed of travel given the distance traveled and the time taken.

                        <p>
                            Average speed is a measure of how quickly an object moves over a given distance. It is commonly expressed in miles per hour (mph) or kilometers per hour (km/h). Average speed is a fundamental concept in physics and is used in various fields such as transportation, sports, and engineering.

                        <p>
                            To use the calculator, simply enter the distance traveled and the time taken in the respective fields below. Then click the "Calculate" button, and the average speed will be displayed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The formula to calculate average speed is:

                        <p className="font-weight-bold">Average Speed = Distance / Time</p>
                        <p>
                            Where:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> The total distance traveled, measured in miles or kilometers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Time:</strong> The total time taken to travel the distance, measured in hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            It's important to note that average speed represents the overall speed of travel over a certain distance and time period. It may not reflect the actual speed at any given moment during the journey, as speed can vary due to factors such as traffic, terrain, and weather conditions.

                        <p>
                            Using the Average Speed Calculator can be helpful for various purposes, such as planning travel routes, estimating travel times, and analyzing performance in sports and other activities.
