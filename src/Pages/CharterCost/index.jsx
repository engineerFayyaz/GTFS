                Our Service Charter Cost Calculator is a handy tool to help you determine the cost of a charter or proposed service based on your cost per hour and or cost per kilometre. Ideal for any business that uses time and distance to cost their services. Some users include:

                If you need to prepare a quote based on time and distance, this tool is for you. Enter the kilometres you will travel and the time it will take you along with your costs for each (Time & Distance) and the calculator will provide you with the costing.
                 
                </p>
                <p>
                You can save the costing and then share it with a client or customer. Your customer will receive an email with a link to the costing for them to review. When you share costing with a client a record of this is saved under the My Profile section for future reference.
                </p>
