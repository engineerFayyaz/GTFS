            <p className="">
              Access to real-time information enhances public transport usage
              and inclusivity. It allows people to smoothly plan their journey
              and manage their time more efficiently. Real-time transit data can
              be used to create optimized routes, prioritizing the needs of the
              public and contributing to a more people-centered public transport
              system, as well as to reduce CO2 emissions.
