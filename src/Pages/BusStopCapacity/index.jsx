                The Bus Stop Capacity Check Tool identifies if sufficient space is available to reasonable accommodate the volume of buses scheduled to use the stop. The tool randomly allocates arrival times of vehicles across a 60 minute window and adds the nominated dwell time.

                <p>The Bus Stop Capacity Check Tool identifies if sufficient space is available to reasonable accommodate the volume of buses scheduled to use the stop. The tool randomly allocates arrival times of vehicles across a 60 minute window and adds the nominated dwell time.</p>
                <p>We then calculate how many vehicles are at the stop at any one time across the hour and compare it to the number of vehicles that can fit on the stop. Where the number of buses at the stop at any onetime (modal intervals) is greater than the number that can physically fit on the stop, it is considered a failure.</p>
                <p>The total number of failures is presented as a percentage of the time periods checks (model intervals). You can adjust the result parameters to match your expectations. The table below shows the default settings for measuring compliance levels.</p>
