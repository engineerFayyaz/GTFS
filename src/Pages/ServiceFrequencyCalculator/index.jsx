                            The frequency of a service is a term often used in the transport industry. It is a term that is also regularly confused with the number of services in an hour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This tool will help you calculate:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Trips per hour (Service Frequency To Trips Per Hour)</li>
                            <li>Service Frequency (Trips Per Hour To Service Frequency)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Determining the service frequency for a transport operation is a key component of the planning process. There are various approaches to determining the appropriate level of frequency:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Policy – some jurisdictions have policy positions that establish a minimum level of service frequency, often referred to as Minimum Service Levels (MSL’s).</li>
                            <li>Loading Analysis – this approach identifies the actual or expected number of passengers per hour or half that will use the service.</li>
                            <li>Frequencies – often referred to as headways, meaning the time between services.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The term “Turn Up and Go” is becoming more and more used to describe services. It’s a customer term used to inform the customer that no timetable is required, simply turn up and the next service will arrive within a short period of time. Essentially, turn up and go services will have a maximum wait time expectation. For example, no greater than 10 minutes.
