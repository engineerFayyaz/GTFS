                  The frequency of a service is a term often used in the
                  transport industry. It is a term that is also regularly
                  confused with the number of services in an hour. For example:
                  a 6 minute frequency means 10 services an hour while 6
                  services an hour means a 10 minute frequency.

                  Determining the service frequency for a transport operation is
                  a key component of the planning process. There are various
                  approaches to determining the appropriate level of frequency,
                  these include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Policy:</strong> Some jurisdictions have policy
                    positions that establish a minimum level of service
                    frequency, these are often referred to as Minimum Service
                    Levels (MSL’s).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Loading Analysis:</strong> This approach identifies
                    the actual or expected number of passengers per hour or half
                    that will use the service. Based on patronage, a calculation
                    using an average number of passengers per bus can be used to
                    derive the number of services within that time period.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Frequencies:</strong> Are often referred to as
                    headways, meaning the time between services. In some
                    jurisdictions, headway is measured to understand contractual
                    compliance. This is an alternate approach to measuring
                    on-time running from a point or points (Start, mid, and/or
                    end).

                  The term “Turn Up and Go” is becoming more and more used to
                  describe services. It’s a customer term used to inform the
                  customer that no timetable is required, simply turn up and the
                  next service will arrive within a short period of time.
                  Essentially, turn up and go services will have a maximum wait
                  time expectation. For example, no greater than 10 minutes.
